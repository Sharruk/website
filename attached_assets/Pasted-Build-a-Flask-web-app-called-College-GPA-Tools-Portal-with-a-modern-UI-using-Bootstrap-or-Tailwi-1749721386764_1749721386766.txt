Build a Flask web app called "College GPA & Tools Portal" with a modern UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind. The app should have a navigation layout like STUCOR's GPA/CGPA Calc app, with the following 4 main calculator pages:

---

1. **GPA Calculator**
   - User can input multiple subjects, each with:
     - Subject name
     - Grade (dropdown: O, A+, A, B+, B, RA)
     - Credit (numeric)
   - Grade mapping:
     - O = 10, A+ = 9, A = 8, B+ = 7, B = 6, RA = 0
   - Formula:  
     `GPA = (Σ (grade point × credit)) / Σ credits`
   - Display the calculated GPA and summary table.

---

2. **CGPA Calculator**
   - User can input GPA and total credits for each semester.
   - Minimum 2 semesters input allowed.
   - Formula:
     `CGPA = (Σ (semester GPA × semester credits)) / Σ semester credits`
   - Display final CGPA result with breakdown.

---

3. **Percentage Calculator**
   - User inputs GPA (or CGPA).
   - Formula:  
     `Percentage = GPA × 10`
   - Display percentage result instantly.

---

4. **Internal Marks Calculator**
   - Inputs per subject:
     - CAT 1, CAT 2, SAT (all out of 100)
     - Assignment 1 & 2 (out of 100)
   - Logic:
     - If CAT 1 is 'AB', use SAT instead for CAT 1.
     - If CAT 2 is 'AB', use SAT instead for CAT 2.
     - CAT 1 → convert to 15 marks (best of CAT 1 or SAT)
     - CAT 2 → convert to 15 marks (best of CAT 2 or SAT)
     - Assignments averaged, converted to 10 marks.
     - Viva = fixed 10 marks
     - Final internal = 15 + 15 + 10 + 10 = **50 marks**
     - Convert to 100-scale by: `internal_mark × 2`
   - Show the breakdown and final internal mark (out of 100).

### Navigation:
- Top navigation bar or side menu:
  - GPA Calculator
  - CGPA Calculator
  - Percentage Calculator
  - Internal Mark Calculator

Design Requirements:
- Use mobile-responsive cards or list styles like in STUCOR.
- Display all formulae below the result clearly.
- Clean layout, no JS required unless essential.
