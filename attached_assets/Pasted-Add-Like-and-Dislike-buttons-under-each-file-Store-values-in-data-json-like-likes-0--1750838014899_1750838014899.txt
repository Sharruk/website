JSON Storage Only:
- All metadata (likes, dislikes, comments, descriptions) must be read from and written to `data.json`.
- No SQL or external database.
- Keep code modular and responsive (works on mobile & desktop).
- Use vanilla JS or a lightweight framework like Alpine.js if needed.
- Ensure UI remains clean and collapsible for better UX.
